Distributed Systems

Overview:

Distributed System
A collection of automata whose distribution is transparent to the user so that
the system appears as one local machine. This is in contrast to a network, 
where the user is aware that there are several machines, and their location, 
storage, replication, load balancing and functionality is not transparent. 
Distributed systems usually use some kind of client-server organization.

Multiple Computers
Interconnections
Shared States

A distributed system is a collection of entities, each of which is autonomous,
programmable, asynchronous and failure-prone, and whihc communicate through an
unreliable communication medium.

Important Distributed Systems Issues:
No global clock, asynchrony
Unpredictable failures of components, failure prone
Highly variable bandwidth
Possibly large and variable latency: few ms to several seconds
Large numbers of hosts: two to several million

Common Goals:
Heterogeneity
Robustness
Availability
Transparency
Concurrency
Efficiency
Scalability
Security
Openness
