\section*{Question 1}
Steps taken:\\
1. used chmod u-s /usr/bin/passwd
2. Tested passwd again to see what permissions were needed
Error received: passwd: Authentication token manipulation error
3. Researched what capabilities passwd needs under the posix capabilities system
4. Capbilities needed: cap_chown, cap_dac_override, cap_fowner, all needed to be
set to ep

From the man pages, the following capabilities grant the following permissions:

cap_chown: Make arbitrary changes to file UIDs and GIDs
cap_dac_override: Bypass file read, write, and execute permission checks.
cap_fowner: Bypass permission checks on operations that normally require the
	filesystem UID of the process to match the UID of the file. Set
	extended file attributes on arbitrary files. Set Access Control Lists
	on arbitrary files.

\section*{Question 2}

cap_dac_read_search: Bypass file read permissions checks and directory read and
	execute permission cehcks.
