Cryptographic Hashes
- Preimage resistance
- Collision resistance
- Second Preimage resistance

HMAC and Strong Collisions
Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code
- Not vulnerable to the birthday attack because you need the key to launch
	the attack

Diffie-Hellman
Allows two parties to create a shared secret while exchanging in the open.
Fairly important to modern cryptography

MitM protection can be created through using a long term key, and an individual
session based key that is disposed of at the end of the session.

Requirements:
- Consistency property: both parties must agree on the session state negotiated
by the protocol, or the protocol must fail
- The mutual Authentication Property: Each party must be able to verify the(?)

- The secrecy property: None of the bits of the key should be guessable(?) 

Curly braces {a,b}_k means encrypted with k
Brackets [a,b]_k means a message authentication code

MAC
- Verifies integrity
- Verifies authenticity
- Can't verify to a third party that you didn't forge the MAC

Signature
- Verifies who sent it
- Verifiable by a third party
- Adds integrity
