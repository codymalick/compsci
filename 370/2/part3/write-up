Strong Hash Collision:
500 Trials, Average: 5370.812, Median: 4911.5

Trial description: Each trial used a randomized string (strong) or a randomized
start hash (weak). 

Overall, strong hash collision was much easier to break. Weak
hash collision on a three byte has took several million trials on average,
while a 3 byte hash took only about five thousand on average using strong hash
collision.

Mathematical description
Weak collision:
The probability of guessing a certain hash out of a 24 bit hash is the very
simple:

Probability = 1/(2^24) = 1/16777216 = 5.9604 * 10^-8

Strong collision:
For this equation, I'm plugging in the average number of attempts for n to give
a reasonable estimate of the probability:

P(5370) = 1 - ((2^24)!/((2^24)^(5370)*(2^24-5370)!))
=.5765

An incredibly large guessing chance for such a small number of attempts.
