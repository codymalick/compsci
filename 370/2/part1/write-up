SHA1:

First Hash:
SHA1(cow)= 3fb6542ba0cc9b35cf14bd8db9d33ac9669a898f
SHA256(cow)= 15fda678dfcc49b7c6e7e77fad66ffd5a5d1fa755df0363d04ce908942896b23

After bit flipped:
SHA1(cow)= ea69777a5effef525b4ef54bf5ee46900f15a6fa 
SHA256(cow)= bf659b85ac3106f0b4672dd4b9eab8c4546bc49d1d28ac2c2b162a7d03ebf5c9

5. The bits between the keys are not similar. They are actually quite different.
I believe this is caused by the avalanche effect, which is in effect in the
SHA1 and SHA256 standard

6.
sha1, a7ee89b1411fcbdf4485f23ba607ae23290ccf68   
sha256, 625df430102e793aec8313128fd5caaeba54a3d1b743e77f0c9c637cb69a3bff

The two hashes are very different between each hash, and their original
unflipped form. Due to the avalanche, these bit flips will completely change the
resulting hash in each case.
