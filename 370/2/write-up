SHA1:
2.
First Hash:
SHA1(cow)= 3fb6542ba0cc9b35cf14bd8db9d33ac9669a898f
SHA256(cow)= 15fda678dfcc49b7c6e7e77fad66ffd5a5d1fa755df0363d04ce908942896b23

After bit flipped:
SHA1(cow)= ea69777a5effef525b4ef54bf5ee46900f15a6fa 
SHA256(cow)= bf659b85ac3106f0b4672dd4b9eab8c4546bc49d1d28ac2c2b162a7d03ebf5c9

5. The bits between the keys are not similar. They are actually quite different.
I believe this is caused by the avalanche effect, which is in effect in the
SHA1 and SHA256 standard
