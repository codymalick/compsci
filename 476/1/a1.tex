	\subsection*{a}
	The simple estimator approached the value of theta in fairly short order,
	though not as quickly as the first conditioning variable.
	\subsection*{b}
	Looks like it approaches the true value of theta faster than the 
	naive approach.
	\subsection*{c}
	I wasn't able to get this one working completely. I was unsure as to
	what it was in my code that was offsetting it by so much.
	\subsection*{d}
	Unfortunately, I was unable to get started on this one.
