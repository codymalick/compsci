      \noindent Concurrency is an important issue when working with shared resources,
      especially resources being actively used by the kernel.
      The problem with sharing resources across threads is safely
      accessing the resources without causing a race condition. This problem is
      solved by using a mutex in order to lock down the resource until the thread
      is done with it's task, then releasing it for other threads. By using this
      process, we can create multithreaded programs that can safely access shared
      resources. Following are the details on how I approached this problem.
