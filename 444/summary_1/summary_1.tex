    In Robert Love's first two chapters, \textit{Introduction to the Linux
    Kernel} and \textit{Getting Started with the Kernel}(\date{2010}), he
    explains the basic knowledge needed to start working with the Linux kernel.
    Love does this by first explaining what a kernel is, how it has evolved, and
    what tools and knowledge are needed to begin contributing to it's
    development. Love's purpose in these chapters is to get the reader to take
    the first steps neccessary to start working with the kernel, in order to
    reduce the barrier of entry into kernel development. The in-depth
    explainations and definitions of different parts of the kernel, as well
    as the short descriptions of certain features of kernel development, imply
    that Love is writing for aspiring kernel developers.
