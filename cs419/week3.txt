Lab 4 - 1/26 - Defense against the dark arts

Malware Defense - Lab 1

Use Yara to analyse samples
Attempt 1:

	Strings that occur throughout the files
		'Jenna Jam' -- doesn't occur in one of the files
		'OFTWARE\Borland\Delphi\RTL' --In four of the files
	Tried creating a rule with these strings involved, encountered errors, could no open file with
	no output. It would seem we're not running a program we were supposed to.

Attempt 2:
	Found out that we are not supposed to get results from system32, which makes sense. Running it
	against both directories (System32 and Malware Directory) to see if we get the proper results

	Attempt 2: no results

Attempt 3:
	Typo in command, returned 7/7 results with positive. This was the rule I used

	rule bad_stuff
	{

		strings:
			$a = "Jenna Jam"
			$b = "OFTWARE\\Borland\\Delphi\\RTL"
		condition:
			$a or $b
	}

Analyse Sample Set 2:
Attempt 1:
	Opened files in FileInsight, looked through output for matching strings. Strings of note:
		Set of chinese characters : File1
		ActiveX Downloader : Bottom of File1
			- japan.edu.ms/DownloaderActiveX.cab#Version=1,0,0,1
			- .ms domain name is for the British Colony Montserrat
			--ActiveX control occurs in all the files, not a unique string
			--Hard to use to find only the required files
