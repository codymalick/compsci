Set up the VM, created snapshot, ran evil.exe and performed a basic analysis of what the exe did to the sytem.
Examined a few of the registry edits, as well as generated files. Also examined some of the web traffic that was
created, basic http requests. One reverse lookup, but I'm not sure what caused it.  

Evil.exe changed many registry files, altered or copied a lot of system32.dll files
Made a few http requests, as well as (potentially) caused a reverse lookup

Files created:
- msvbvm60.dll
- sechost.dll
- imm32.dll
- funbots.bat
- svchest.exe - Generated by the evil.exe file

Http Requests:
- timeless888.com
- hisunpharm.com
- Reverse Look Up, Domain Name: c.0.0.....0.2.0.f.f.ip6
