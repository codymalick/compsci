Lab 2 - Defense Against the Dark Arts
String Analysis

Sample 1:
- Analysing different window's tool versions
	- Explorer
- "This program cannot be run in DOS mode"
	- prompts the user to run the program
- Registry entries

Sample 2:
- Select * from Win32_DiskParition WHERE BootPartition = true
	- pulling large chunks of data from the registry
- Your PC is blocked. All the hard drives were encrypted. Browse www.safe-data.ru
	- Sample 2 seems to be some sort of cryptoware that encrypts the hard drive, or
	pretends to encrypt the hard drive to get the user to pay them to unlock the hard
	drive.

Sample 3:
- Not sure what's happening, but it's changing file pointers, wasn't able to see much
	with only static analysis
