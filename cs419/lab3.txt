Lab 3 - Defense against the dark arts

Using volatility to analyse a memory dump

First we run Image Info to figure out what version of the operating system
is running, because different versions of windows have different memory structures

- Imageinfo
	Image date and time: 2015-01-06 15:51:57 UTC+000
	Image Local Date and Time: 2015-01-06 07:51:57 -0800
	Suggested profile: Win7SP0x86
	Number of processors: 1
	Image Type (Service Packs) 1

--profile=Win7SP0x86 psscan
	Process Scan using the Win7 Service Pack 0 x86 profile
	Dumps a list of processes that were running when the memory dump
		was created
	evil.exe -- PID:1216 PPID: 1316 PDB:0x0be9d000
		ParentId: explorer.exe

--dllist -p<id>
	Used to find the DLLs a file used
	Ran with evil.exe pid
	Very long list of results. 

--Deskscan

--Getsids

--netscan
	Displays all exes or processes that are communicating over the network
	evil.exe looks like it opens UDP Port 65287 and is listening
