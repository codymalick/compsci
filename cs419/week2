Lab 2 - Defense Against the Dark Arts
String Analysis

Sample 1:
- Analysing different window's tool versions
	- Explorer
- "This program cannot be run in DOS mode"
	- prompts the user to run the program
- Registry entries

Sample 2:
- Select * from Win32_DiskParition WHERE BootPartition = true
	- pulling large chunks of data from the registry
- Your PC is blocked. All the hard drives were encrypted. Browse www.safe-data.ru
	- Sample 2 seems to be some sort of cryptoware that encrypts the hard drive, or
	pretends to encrypt the hard drive to get the user to pay them to unlock the hard
	drive.
- 

Sample 3:
- Not sure what's happening, but it's changing file pointers, wasn't able to see much
	with only static analysis

Using volatility to analyse a memory dump

First we run Image Info to figure out what version of the operating system
is running, because different versions of windows have different memory structures

- Imageinfo
	Image date and time: 2015-01-06 15:51:57 UTC+000
	Image Local Date and Time: 2015-01-06 07:51:57 -0800
	Suggested profile: Win7SP0x86
	Number of processors: 1
	Image Type (Service Packs) 1

--profile=Win7SP0x86 psscan
	Process Scan using the Win7 Service Pack 0 x86 profile
	Dumps a list of processes that were running when the memory dump
		was created
	evil.exe -- PID:1216 PPID: 1316 PDB:0x0be9d000
		ParentId: explorer.exe

--dllist -p<id>
	Used to find the DLLs a file used
	Ran with evil.exe pid
	Very long list of results. 

--Deskscan

--Getsids

--netscan
	Displays all exes or processes that are communicating over the network
	evil.exe looks like it opens UDP Port 65287 and is listening
