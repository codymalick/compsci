\section{}
This is an interesting problem. To get the answer, we need to construct an NFA,
reverse it, then construct a regex statement out of it. So, our initial NFA 
looks like this: \\

Reverse the NFA: \\

And then tranlate that into a new regex statement:\\
\noindent $b(ba+baa)^*$

\section{}
To show that this DFA has at least 1024 states, we need to prove that having
less that 1024 states rejects a string in $A$, or show that there is a string
not in the language $A$ that the machine accepts. More specifically, we can
show that if machine $M$ has $<1024$ states, then feeding a string with $1024$
characters must prove there is a cycle, showing that it is regular.\\

This can be shown by accounting for every possible combination after the cycle
ends of alphabet $\{a,b\}^*$ leading up to the accepting state. This leaves us
with $2^{10}$ combinations. If we propose that the machine $M$ has less than 1024
states, then we can provide a string of length: number of states + 1, then we
can show there is a string that is rejected by $M$.

Given alphabet $A=\{a,b\}^*$, consider all strings of length 10, $w\in A$. Given
a string of length ten, there are two possible combinations for each position
in the string. Therefore, the total number of possible combinations of strings
are $2^{10}$.

Given that the number of states is less than 1024, then there must be a
combination in the alphabet $A$ that is not accepted.

Step 1:\\
Adversary picks $p$\\
Step 2:\\
I select $w=a^p b^p c^{p-p}$, where $|w|>=p$, and $w \in A$ and $w \in
$ real numbers\\
Step 3:\\
Split into $w=xyz$ where $|xy|=<p$, and $|y|>0$ \\
Step 4:\\
I pick $i=0$, I win if $xy^iz \notin A$\\
Then $xy^0z=xz=a^{p-|y|}c^0 \notin A$ since $|y|>0$\\
I win, A is not regular.
