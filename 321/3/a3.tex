This was a particularlly tricky one. You need to handle all even numbered cases,
and the case that you start with an a or b, then have a ton of stuff in the
middle, then an a at the end. Here is my long regex to handle this problem. I
use line breaks whenever there is an 'or' for ease of reading:\\
$(aa)^*(bb)^*+\\
((ab)(ab))^*+\\
((ab)(ba))^*+\\
((ba)(ab))^*+\\
((ba)(ba))^*+\\
a((aa)^*(bb)^*((ab)(ab))^*((ab)(ba))^*((ba)(ab))^*((ba)(ba))^*)a+\\
b((aa)^*(bb)^*((ab)(ab))^*((ab)(ba))^*((ba)(ab))^*((ba)(ba))^*)b$

Prove: Let $M(w)$ be the statement that, for any regular language,$w \in \Sigma\{0,1\}^*$,
, the string is a multiple of three if and only if its reverse
, $rev(w)$, is also a multiple of three.\\\\

Initial Step: We must verify that the reversed form of binary 3, '11', is a
multiple of three, $M(w)$ where $w=11$: \\

$M(rev(11))=M(11)$\\

Then the reversed binary form of 3 is equal to 3, which is a multiple of 3.\\\\

Inductive Step: Assume there is a string k that is representative of a value
greater than or equal to zero, that is a multiple of 3. Prove
that $M(k+3)$ is also a multiple of 3:\\

$M(k+3)=M(rev(k+3))=$
